### Adapt Super-resolution into real production  
#### 08/2018-11/2018
- **Tutor:** [Bart Selman from Cornell University](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/selman/) 
- **Purpose:** Used symmetric padding to improve perceptual quality of image after super-resolution   
- **Duties:** Edited code to realize VDSR using tensorflow and symmetric padding to process the images with three channels; Used EC2 of AWS to do experiments using classic Datasets (ImageNet, Set5, Set14) and evaluated the outcomes via PSNR and SSIM; Wrote the Introduction and Experiment&Analysis of the final paper
